= Manual Credit Notes

HMC supports processing payments from the Operator to the Sellers via the creation of Manual Credit Notes in Mirakl. The processing works the same as for automatically generated invoice documents and as described in Section 5.1.

This is provided only to facilitate payment testing and has important consequences when used.

Since Mirakl includes manual credit notes in its billing cycle calculations, manual credit note amounts will be included in automatic invoices.

[WARNING]
.Enabling manual credit notes processing on production
====
If the connector has manually paid a manual credit note and a seller has had orders/refunds in the same billing cycle, the amount in the credit note will be included and paid a second time as part of an automatic invoice.

For this reason, it *is strongly urged to only use manual credit notes in test environments while testing*, to ensure that payments can be made in an end-to-end setup between Mirakl, the HMC, and Hyperwallet.
====

The Manual Credit Note processing feature is *disabled* by default, but can optionally be configured through the following Environment Variable (see README for further details such as format and default value):

* PAYPAL_HYPERWALLET_OPERATOR_CREDIT_NOTES_ENABLED

*Note on Refunds*:

Please note that HMC is responsible for facilitating payout to the Sellers and Operator, which includes the money that is owed to the Seller or Operator.

Customer refunds are processed as part of the pay-in functionality and are covered by the Braintree-Mirakl connector scope. This is a separate connector service provided as part of the overall PayPal product offering.

In instances when the Seller balance in Mirakl becomes negative (e.g. to enable the Seller to honour customer refunds) Mirakl allows creation of Manual credit notes. This allows replenishment of the Seller bank account balance, which involves a payout element.
